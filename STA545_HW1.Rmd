## R Markdown

This was my first attempt at using RMarkdown. There were several discontinuity in packages (MacTex) and the version of R I have downloaded on my computer. Additionally when running both the template provided on UB Learns and by creating my own template via the RMarkdown cheat-sheet the following error was generated for the first line of script:

Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]) : 
  namespace ‘xfun’ 0.13 is already loaded, but >= 0.15 is required
  


```{r Wage}
#install.packages("MacTex")
install.packages("ISLR")
#library(MacTex)
library(ISLR)
summary(Wage)
```
